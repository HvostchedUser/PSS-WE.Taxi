## Project description
This is a simple taxi backend simulation.
If you just want to see the simulation, just press Enter.
If you want to go on a ride, login using someone's account and make an order.
If you want to take someone through the route, login using the driver's account and accept the ride.
## Features
* The distance between two points is the difference in lengths of names of origin and destination. This taxi can drive you from any string to any other string!
* Every step of the simulation is saved in the main.txt file, so you can stop the program and run again, and nothing will change until you remove main.txt file.
* Every name is procedurally generated. Every destination is procedurally generated. Every car model is procedurally generated!
